INCENDIUM | Spot That Fire V2.0 Virtual Participation

The Challenge | Spot That Fire V2.0

Your challenge is to create an application that leverages NASA's near-real-time and archival wildfire datasets along with other tools to support firefighting and fire mitigation efforts. This challenge builds on last yearâ€™s challenge of the same name by calling for innovative ideas and apps that focus on how to engage and enable citizens to assist with the entire firefighting and fire mitigation process.

THE PROBLEM:

Unreported fire can be catastrophic. INCENDIUM provides a platform to report fire incidents by any method , including text, photos and videos. INCENDIUM locates the fire accessing NASA open data sources and automatically inform the authorities for you.

OUR APPROACH:

Wildfire causes a significant threat to both human and animals. The latest California wildfire resulted in 100,000 evacuations and left millions without power. Unreported fire, almost always man made, is thought to be the cause of 90% of the wildfires. Therefore, we created a platform - incendium- to report, interact and get prompt attention to the on going wildfires. Incendium is a website we created using morbrise software which hosted on GitHub. Users can report incidence of wildfire using any method of their choice, such as text, photos and videos. Incendium locates the fire accessing NASA near real time MODIS(C6) and VIRS(375m) active fire data , embedded in the website. After clarifying the reported fire with the NASA data, Incendium reports the fire location to the emergency responders .

LIMITATIONS:

One of the major constraints we faced was the limited amount of time allocated for the project development.

Also, we lacked the emergency responders database to include in the platform.

Future directions

It might be plausible to use machine learning to automatically match locations to report and verify fires and provide statistics about people and animals in the fire area.

In conclusion ,our system would be connected to 1st line responder!! Similar to that of public schools use to alert a fire breaks out to the fire department automatically.

Our system would alert the 1st responders to the emergency and location.
